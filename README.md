# **TMPBDSniffer**

In this work we defined the binding domain of TMPs according to the binding region investigation of multiple conjugate types. The experimental results proved such binding domains existing on the surface of TMPs, and they are structural specific distinguishing to the surface regions without any binding activities.

## Citation

The existence of TMPs binding domain have been proved and published in the the 2021 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM).
